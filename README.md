# deprecations-io/symfony-bundle

deprecations-io/symfony-bundle is a Symfony bundle integrating the [deprecations.io](https://deprecations.io) 
service into Symfony applications.

deprecations.io is a plug-and-play service to monitor and update your usages of deprecated features from your 
vendors, keeping your code ready for every major version to come. 

Keeping your code up-to-date was never this easy!

## Installation

deprecations-io/symfony-bundle requires PHP 5.3+ and Symfony 2.8+.

> **Note:** If you are using a version of Symfony lower than 2.8, you should be able to safely
> upgrade to Symfony 2.8 without any code changes. Once done, you will be able to use deprecations.io
> to track your deprecations and upgrade to Symfony 3 (and then forward!).

## Setup

* [Symfony 2.8](docs/setup-2.8.md)
* [Symfony 3.x](docs/setup-3.md)
